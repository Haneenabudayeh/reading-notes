# HTML Events
## An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

## Here are some examples of HTML events:

* An HTML web page has finished loading
* An HTML input field was changed
* An HTML button was clicked

### Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

### JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

### HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

# TO BIND AN EVENT TO AN ELEMENT:
- HTML EVENT HANDLERS.
- TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS.
- DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT LISTENERS.

- Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. They can deal with more than one function at a time but they are not supported in older browsers.

- EVENT DELEGATION Creating event listeners for a lot of elements can slow down a page, but event flow allows you to listen for an event on a parent element.

- CHANGING DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: preventDefau1t (), stopPropagation(), USING BOTH METHODS.

- User interface (UI) events occur as a result of interaction with the browser window rather than the HTML page contained within it, e.g., a page having loaded or the browser window being resized.

# HTML Forms:
Forms best way to collect information from visitors.

Form elements are different types of input elements, like:text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more.

The <input> element is the most important form element.

Examples:

- <input type=”text”> Defines a single-line text input field.
- <input type=”radio”> Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
- <input type=”submit”> Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
## The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements. The element is for screen-reader users, the screen-reader will read out load the label when the user is focused on the input element.
