# Transforms
With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements.

## Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

## 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. 
- Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
- Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.
